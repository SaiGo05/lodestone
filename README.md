The lodestone is a PoC application that I made to learn how to scrape information from the internet.
The reason I've decided to call it lodestone is because it is gathering data from a videogame titled Final Fantasy XIV.
Making this was fun because it not only was educational but I was also able to integrate one of my videogames into it.
